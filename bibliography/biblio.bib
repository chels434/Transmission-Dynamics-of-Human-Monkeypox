  abstract = {The largest recorded Ebola virus disease epidemic began in March 2014; as of July 2015, it continued in 3 principally affected countries: Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Control efforts include contact tracing to expedite identification of the virus in suspect case-patients. We examined contact tracing activities during September 20-December 31, 2014, in 2 prefectures of Guinea using national and local data about case-patients and their contacts. Results show less than one third of case-patients (28.3{\%} and 31.1{\%}) were registered as contacts before case identification; approximately two thirds (61.1{\%} and 67.7{\%}) had no registered contacts. Time to isolation of suspected case-patients was not immediate (median 5 and 3 days for Kindia and Faranah, respectively), and secondary attack rates varied by relationships of persons who had contact with the source case-patient and the type of case-patient to which a contact was exposed. More complete contact tracing efforts are needed to augment control of this epidemic.},

@article{Jezek1987,
  abstract = {With the eradication of smallpox; systematic routine vaccination with vaccinia has ceased and an Increasing proportion of the human population In tropical rain forest areas of central and western Africa lacks vaccinia-derived immunity to monkeypox virus. This raises the question of the ability of monkeypox virus to establish and maintain itself In an unvaccinated population through continuous man-to-man transmission. A computerized stochastic model of Monte Carlo type was constructed to assess this potential risk. Simulated series were repeated 100 times to obtain distributions of predicted outcomes for decreasing levels of vaccination coverage (70 per cent, 50 per cent, and 0 per cent). The results revealed a substantial increase in new secondary cases in the total absence of vaccinia-Induced immunity. Nevertheless, none of the simulated series did lead to an “explosive” epidemic. The model clearly indicated diminishing numbers of cases In successive generations and eventual cessation of transmission. There fore, it appears highly hnprobable that the virus could maintain Itself permanently in communities by interhuman transmission. After the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox constitutes the most important orthopoxvirus Infection in man, but analysis of Information collected up to this time suggests that it does not represent currently a serious public health problem or a challenge to the achieved eradication of smallpox.},

@article{Blumberg2013,
  abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>This paper focuses on infectious diseases such as monkeypox, Nipah virus and avian influenza that transmit weakly from human to human. These pathogens cannot cause self-sustaining epidemics in the human population, but instead cause limited transmission chains that stutter to extinction. Such pathogens would go extinct if they were confined to humans, but they persist because of continual introduction from an external reservoir (such as animals, for the zoonotic diseases mentioned above). They are important to study because they pose a risk of emerging if they become more transmissible, or conversely to monitor the success of efforts to locally eliminate a pathogen by vaccination. A crucial challenge for these ‘stuttering’ pathogens is to quantify their transmissibility, in terms of the intensity and heterogeneity of disease transmission by infected individuals. In this paper, we use monkeypox as an example to show how these transmission properties can be estimated from commonly available data describing the size of observed stuttering chains. These results make it easier to monitor diseases that pose a risk of emerging (or re-emerging) as self-sustaining human pathogens, or to decide whether a seemingly large chain may signal a worrisome change in transmissibility.</p>},

@phdthesis{Hoff2014,
  abstract = {Background: Monkeypox (MPX) virus is a zoonotic infection found in a variety of mammals, and infects humans with a smallpox-like illness. In the 30 years since the eradication of smallpox, monkeypox has emerged as the most severe orthopox infection occurring in humans. Most cases have been, and continue to be, reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where MPX is a reportable disease to the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) unit. Despite the inclusion of MPX in the surveillance system, there may still be a number of limitations as to how accurately and how systematically this data has been collected, thus it is necessary to explore available data for trends in disease occurrence and reporting. Methods: IDSR data consists of weekly reports on 15 diseases of epidemic potential or targeted for elimination or eradication. Case counts of all reportable diseases including MPX, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), measles and tetanus reported via the IDSR unit to the 4th Direction in the Ministry of Health of the DRC were available from January 1 st , 2001 through December 31st , 2013. The country is made up of over 10,000 public health facilities, which are required to report to the IDSR each week. Data available from the reports include: number of suspected cases and deaths, health zone, province, week reported, and numbers disaggregated by age category. A number of statistical methods were used to determine change in incidence, associations and comparisons with other diseases and lab reporting, and time series analysis. Additionally a model was created with parameters to determine the gaps in the system and to quantify the potential underreporting of suspected MPX cases. Results: Between 2001 and 2013, three phases of the surveillance system were identified: the implementation phase (2001-2003), the adjustment phase (2004-2007), and the stable phase (2008-2013). Overall, there was an increase in suspected MPX cases reported via the IDSR. In total, 19,437 suspected cases and 336 suspected deaths (1.7{\%} case fatality rate) were reported. During our study period, the mean number of reported MPX cases weekly was 42 (range: 0 -125). There were provincial differences in MPX reporting by week, however no significant trends were identified. Laboratory confirmed polio cases in a health zone had a negative impact on MPX, tetanus and measles reporting, but had a positive impact on AFP reporting. Health zones with confirmed cases of MPX had a positive association with MPX reporting, but a significant negative association with other diseases (AFP, measles and tetanus). We estimated that the possible under-reporting rate was 9.4 (range 5.0 to 15.2), with the majority (56{\%}) of the cases being missed due to under-ascertainment of health services, and 8.3{\%} lost due to inability to pay for services or visiting locations outside of he public health sector. Discussion: Based on trends from 2008-2013, the stable reporting phase, the increase in MPX is likely to be a true increase. The analyses indicate that while the system should be integrated (disease detection and confirmation) for all reportable diseases, that each component may only work within the specific diseases. Each missed case of a person with a suspected disease reduces the true incidence of that disease, leading to underestimates of disease burden. We estimate that only about 10{\%} of the actual cases are making it to the national level. This could significantly limit the ability to detect emerging public health problems.},
