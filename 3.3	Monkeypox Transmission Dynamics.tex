\subsection{3.3	Monkeypox Transmission Dynamics}

Of the 293 confirmed MPX cases reporting after contacts, 87 individuals (29.2\%) started a chain of transmission, infecting 96 individual secondary cases, who represented 166 reported contacts due to their contact with multiple cases. Each contact was listed by an average of 1.28 cases (Table 4). The crude absolute secondary attack rate was found to be 0.067 (Table 5).  

Upon stratification into household and non-household contacts, 1224 individuals were listed in 1548 reports of household contacts, and 190 individuals were listed in 269 reports of non-household contacts. We found   for both individual contacts and total reported contacts to determine the best method of comparison to the 1980s reports. Individual   was 0.070 for household contacts and 0.047 for non-household, while total  was 0.091 and 0.089 for household and non-household contacts, respectively (Table 5). Using Equation 2, we found the individual Reff to be 0.419, and the total Reff to be 0.570. These values indicate the average number of secondary cases caused by each case, accounting for differences in attack rates between household and non-household contacts.
