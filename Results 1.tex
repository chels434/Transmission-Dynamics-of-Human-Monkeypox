\subsection{Characteristics of MPX Cases and Contacts}

* add: GPS coordinates were collected for approximately 58\% of cases investigated. 

During the 2005-2007 active surveillance program in nine health zones of the Sankuru district, 1407 suspected cases were investigated, of which 733 cases (55.5\%) were confirmed positive for MPX. Of these cases, 295 individuals (39.9\%) reported contact tracing information, with 139 case-patients reporting contact events with 218 symptomatic individuals in the three weeks before illness onset. A total of xx (xx\%) before contacts had been investigated as a case and xx (xx\%) were confirmed MPX+. A total of 2543 contact events with 1863 individuals in the three weeks after symptom onset were reported by all 295 case-patients (Table 2). Contacts were partitioned into household or non-household contacts, with household contacts comprising 67\% of before contacts and 84\% of after contacts (Table 2). There were significantly more household after contacts compared to the 1980s, when only 53\% of all contacts were household (P < 0.001). The average number of before contacts per case was 1.57 (range, 1-6), and the average number of after contacts was 6.27 (range, 1-21) contacts per case. 

Overall, 2847 individuals were reported as having close contact with a suspected case, for a total of 3404 contact reports. Of these, 
subsequently, 280 individuals from 397 contact reports were investigated as cases, with 113 individuals and 193 reports confirmed positive for MPX infection.

The majority of before and after contacts were reported to be siblings (56\% and 51\% respectively), with parents comprising 22\% of after contacts and only 9\% of before
contacts (Figure 4). Individuals external to family were only 4\% of the reported after contacts, however, 13\% of the symptomatic before contacts were external, suggesting instances of household-to-household transmission. Differences in relationship frequencies in before and after contacts may also represent differences in caretaking and susceptibility patterns; for example, no grandparents were indicated as before contacts while 4\% of after contacts were grandparents (Figure 4).
