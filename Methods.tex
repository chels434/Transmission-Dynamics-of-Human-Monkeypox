\section{Methods}

From 2005 to 2007, the UCLA-DRC Research Group, in coordination with the DRC’s Ministry of Health (MOH), facilitated an active surveillance program to identify cases of human MPX in the Sankuru district of Kasai Oriental province, in central DRC, the same region as the 1980’s WHO program. The active surveillance protocol and results are reported in Rimoin et al \cite{Rimoin2010}.
