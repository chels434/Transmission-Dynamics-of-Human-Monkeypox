\subsection{Definitions}
Similar to algorithms described previously,4,9,41 an investigated \textit{source case} was classified as \textit{primary} if it was the first case investigated in an independent outbreak chain, or had no history of contact with a symptomatic human within three weeks before rash onset. Primary cases were assumed to be caused by an animal source. \textit{Onset} is defined as the first day of rash presentation and is considered the first day of infectiousness. Investigated source cases were asked to report all \textit{contacts}, defined as individuals coming into direct contact with a case, in the three weeks after onset. As individuals may have been reported as contacts of multiple cases, each report was considered a \textit{contact event}. \textit{Household contacts} were defined as those residing in the same household as the source case.

A \textit{chain of transmission} includes the primary case, and all subsequent cases stemming from this initial infection. A \textit{cluster} of cases may contain chains arising from multiple primary cases.29 Cases in the same chain or cluster with an onset less than seven days after exposure to the primary case were classified as \textit{co-primary case}s. Any cases with an onset 7-34 days after reported contact with a symptomatic primary case was classified as a \textit{secondary case} of the first generation, and assumed to be caused by a human source. The \textit{generation} of secondary cases was determined by their location within the temporally classified chains of transmission.29

\textit{Secondary attack rates} are defined as the proportion of new cases among contact events, within the known incubation period \cite{Dixon2015}. Attack rates can be compared to the \textit{effective reproductive number} ($R_{eff}$), which is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by each individual case, with regard to population susceptibility.10,27 This is as opposed to the \textit{basic reproductive number} ($R_{0}$), which is the average number of secondary cases caused by each case in a completely susceptible population.29
