\subsection*{Monkeypox Transmission Dynamics}
Of the 293 confirmed MPX cases reporting after contacts, 87 individuals (29.2\%) started a chain of transmission, infecting 96 individual secondary cases, who represented 166 reported contacts due to their contact with multiple cases. Each contact was listed by an average of 1.28 cases (Table 4). The crude absolute secondary attack rate was found to be 0.067 (Table 5).

To investigate population perception of the source of MPX infection, we determined the proportion of each type and rank of case that thought they acquired MPX from an animal, human or other source, stratified by whether there was another case of rash illness in their village in the month prior to disease onset (Table 6).
