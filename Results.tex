\subsection*{Monnkeypox Transmission Dynamics}
Of the 293 confirmed MPX cases reporting after contacts, 87 individuals (29.2\%) started a chain of transmission, infecting 96 individual secondary cases, who represented 166 reported contacts due to their contact with multiple cases. Each contact was listed by an average of 1.28 cases (Table 4). The crude absolute secondary attack rate was found to be 0.067 (Table 5).

Differences between crude secondary attack rates (ARcrude) and effective reproduction number (Reff) between the active surveillance studies taking place 1981-1986, and 2005-2007. The data from the 1980s is reported as total contact reports, while the more recent study was able to identify individuals who were reported as a contact of multiple cases.}
