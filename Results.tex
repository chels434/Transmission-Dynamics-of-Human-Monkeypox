\subsection*{Monkeypox Transmission Dynamics}
Of the 293 confirmed MPX cases reporting after contacts, 87 individuals (29.2\%) started a chain of transmission, infecting 96 individual secondary cases, who represented 166 reported contacts due to their contact with multiple cases. Each contact was listed by an average of 1.28 cases (Table 4). The crude absolute secondary attack rate was found to be 0.067 (Table 5).
